            The Ottendorf Cypher is a simple substitution cypher that uses a book or other text as the key.
            Normally, each letter in the message you want to encode is encoded as a page, word and letter
            from the key text.
        </p>
        <p>
            These bookmarklets let you use the text of a web page as the key text. You can then encode or
            decode messages. Of course, this is dependent on the page not changing.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can then exchange messages with someone else who knows the key text page URL by sending them
            the coded message. You could also use it to store secret reminders for yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>Installing</h3>
        <p>
            This only really works on desktop browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need to drag the bookmarklets to your bookmarks bar. If you can't see a bookmarks bar, go to
            the "View" menu and select "Show Bookmarks Bar" or "Show Favourites Bar", then drag the buttons into it.
        </p>

        <h3>Encoding</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you are on a page you want to use as the key text, click the "Cypher Encode" bookmarklet.</li>
            <li>You will be asked for the message you want to encode.</li>
            <li>The coded message will be displayed at the top of the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Decoding</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you are on the page that was used as the key text for encoding, click the "Cypher Decode"
                bookmarklet.</li>
            <li>You will be asked for the coded message.</li>
            <li>The decoded message will be displayed in a pop-up window.</li>
        </ul>
